They are part of the Antiappennini, a group running from the Apennines chain to the Tyrrhenian Sea, where they form the promontory of Gaeta. They are bounded northwestward by the Ausoni Mountains, northward by the Liri river, eastward by the Ausente, southeastward by the Garigliano and southward by the Tyrrhenian sea. The line between the Aurunci and the Ausoni has not been clearly established but the Aurunci are considered by convention to be east of a line through Fondi, Lenola, Pico, S. Giovanni and Incarico. Altitudes vary from hills to the 1,533 m of Monte Petrella. Main peaks include the Redentore (1,252 m) and Monte Sant'Angelo (1,402 m). They include a Regional Park, the Parco Naturale dei Monti Aurunci, created in 1997. The mountains take the name from the ancient tribe of the Aurunci, an offshoot of the Ausoni. Both tribes were derived from the Italic people who were called by the Romans the Volsci; hence, the Monti Lepini, the Monti Ausoni and the Monti Aurunci are also called the Volsci or Volscian Chain. Coincidentally they are all of the same karst topography and have the same orogeny, which is not quite the same as the Apennines proper."},"link":{"type":"uri","value":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurunci_Mountains"},"thumbnail":{"type":"uri","value":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Aurunci_mountains.jpg/200px-Aurunci_mountains.jpg"},"types":{"type":"literal","value":"Mountain ranges of Italy"}},{"label":{"type":"literal","value":"Latium adiectum"},"lng":{"type":"typed-literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float","value":"13.4167"},"lat":{"type":"typed-literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float","value":"41.35"},"abstract":{"type":"literal","xml:lang":"en","value":"Latium adiectum or Latium Novum is an ancient Roman geographical term used at least as early as the 1st century AD, when mention of it occurs in Pliny in conjunction with Latium antiquum, the original territory of the Latini tribe. Says Pliny of the latter:\"Its inhabitants have often changed: at various times it has been occupied by various peoples - the Aborigines, the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Siculi, the Aurunci, the Rutuli .... \" Then he speaks of a later extension to the river Garigliano, to include the Volsci, Osci and Ausones. The \"last town\" in the Adiectum Latium, or \"Extension of Latium\", was Sinuessa. Pliny's remarks concerning Latium are part of his description of Italy:\"... a land which is at once the nurseling and the mother of all other lands, chosen by providence of the gods to make heaven itself more glorious, to unite scattered empires, to make manners gentle, to draw together in converse by community of language the jarring and uncouth tongues of so many nations, to give mankind civilization, and in a word to become throughout the world the single fatherland of all the races. \" After waxing yet more eloquent concerning Italy - he was in fact north Italian himself, rather than Roman - he then gives:\"an account of a circuit of Italy, and of its cities. Herein it is necessary to premise that we intend to follow the authority of his late Majesty Augustus, and to adopt the division that he made of the whole of Italy into eleven regions .... \" Latium and Campania together comprise Region I, of which Latium is divided into Latium Vetus or Antiquus and Latium Adiectum or Novum."},"link":{"type":"uri","value":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latium_adiectum"},"thumbnail":{"type":"uri","value":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Convolvolo_verso_Fondi.JPG/200px-Convolvolo_verso_Fondi.JPG"},"types":{"type":"literal","value":"Roman sites in Italy"}},{"label":{"type":"literal","value":"Siege of Gaeta (1860)"},"lng":{"type":"typed-literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float","value":"13.5547"},"lat":{"type":"typed-literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float","value":"41.2219"},"abstract":{"type":"literal","xml:lang":"en","value":"For other sieges of this city at different dates, see Siege of Gaeta.

Although a headland, it was not formed by coastal erosion–as headlands are usually formed–but is a remnant of the orogenic processes that created the Apennines. The entire coast of Lazio, on which the mountain and the marsh are located, was a chain of barrier islands that was formed on a horst, made part of the mainland by sedimentation of the intervening graben. Monte Circeo, as it is sometimes also called in Italian, is located on the southwest coast of Italy, about 100 kilometres (62 mi) south/southeast of Rome, near San Felice Circeo, on the coast between Anzio and Terracina. At the northern end of the Gulf of Gaeta, it is about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) long by 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) wide at the base, running from east to west and surrounded by the sea on all sides except the north. The land to the north of it is 15 metres (49 ft) above sea level, while the summit of the promontory is 541 metres (1,775 ft). While the headland is quite steep and hilly, the land immediately to the east of it is low-lying and very swampy. Most of the ancient swamp has been reclaimed for agriculture and urban areas. The mountain, the coastal zone as far north as Latina, including the only remaining remnant of the swamp, and two of the Pontine Islands offshore, Zannone and Ponza, have been included in the Circeo National Park. The mountain is composed mostly of marl and sandstone from the Paleogene and of limestone from the lower Early Jurassic."},"link":{"type":"uri","value":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Circeo"},"thumbnail":{"type":"uri","value":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Terracina-vista01.jpg/200px-Terracina-vista01.jpg"},"types":{"type":"literal","value":"Peninsulas of Italy,Headlands of Italy,place,mountain"}}]
